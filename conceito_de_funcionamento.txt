The user (Doctor) must login in the web app to access the main page. Then the user need to select one patient from the list of patients.
To begin a session the user must press the New Session button that will redirect to a new page with a start session button.
The user ask the patient to dress the kneepad and walk for around 2 minutes to get used to it.
To begin the session the user must press the start button.
When the start button is pressed a messages is sent to the kneepad via MQTT protocol and a beep is played.
When the beep is played the patient must start walking during all the session so the values sent from the arduino to the web app are all usable.
When the session ends another beep is played.
Then the patient may undress the kneepad. Meanwhile the values are already available to in the web app for analysis.
