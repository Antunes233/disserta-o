1. Introduction
   - Purpose: Create a system that simplifies the diagnosis of a patient for knee injuries/trauma.
   - Scope: Covers the functionalities for doctors, patients, administrators, and the Arduino device.
   - Overview: A web application that allows doctors to manage patient data, conduct sessions, review results, and receive data from an Arduino device via MQTT.

2. System Description
   - System Overview: The system consists of a frontend, backend, database, MQTT broker, machine learning models, and an Arduino device.
   - Key Features: User authentication, patient management, session management, MQTT communication, machine learning inference, and Arduino integration.

3. User Classes and Characteristics
   - Doctors: Manage patient data, conduct sessions, review results.
   - Patients: Have their data recorded and reviewed.
   - Administrators: Manage the system and user accounts.
   - Arduino Device: Reads values from an encoder and sends them via MQTT to the web application.

4. Operational Scenarios
   - Login and Authentication: Doctors log in using their credentials.
   - Patient Management: Doctors view and update patient information.
   - Session Management: Doctors start and review patient sessions.
   - MQTT Communication: System receives and processes MQTT messages.
   - Machine Learning Inference: System predicts knee flexion using a machine learning model.
   - Arduino Integration: Arduino reads encoder values and sends them via MQTT to the web application.

5. System Requirements
   - Functional Requirements: User authentication, patient management, session management, MQTT communication, machine learning inference, Arduino integration.
   - Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, security, usability.

6. Operational Environment
   - Hardware Requirements: Servers, network infrastructure, Arduino device with an encoder.
   - Software Requirements: Operating systems, databases, web servers.
   - Network Requirements: Network connectivity and bandwidth.


7. Assumptions
   - Assumptions: Users have internet access, doctors have basic computer skills, Arduino device is properly configured.
